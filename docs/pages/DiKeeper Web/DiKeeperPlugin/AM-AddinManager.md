# Addin Manager

In this tab, you will find a list of all the plugins installed on your computer and you will be able to manage them. This list includes the name of the application, the version, the specific user, the installation location and the on/off status.

- Use the switch button in the On/Off column to activate or deactivate a plugin.
- Use the search box to find a plugin.
- Make sure you don't have Revit or AutoCAD open to perform actions on the plugins.

```yaml
Make sure you open the Application Manager as Administrator. If you haven't opened it this way, you won't have permissions to act on the plug-ins.
```
